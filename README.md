# pyneurode
pyneurode (Python + neuron + node) is a real-time signal processing framework for neural recordings, with a special focus on online spike sorting and neural signal decoding in the Open Ephys GUI. It has a robust architecture for parallel processing and can sort hundreds of channel of tetrode signals in real-time.
