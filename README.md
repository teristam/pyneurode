# pyneurode
pyneurode (Python + neuron + node) is a real-time signal processing framework for neural recordings, with a special focus on online spike sorting and neural signal decoding in the Open Ephys GUI. It has a robust architecture for parallel processing and can sort hundreds of channel of tetrode signals in real-time.

For technical details please see our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.18.476764v1)

Please see the [documentation](https://pyneurode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for how to use the library.

The project is still under heavy development. Please submit an issue if you encounter any problem.
